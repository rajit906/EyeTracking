# EyeTracking

Ree.py detects pupil

eyetrack.py crops everything out except the left eye

Load.py takes in data from train/ and test/, trains it and loads it into xModels/ and yModels/

TrackandTrain.py takes the model parameters and trains it further to fit labels

GetEyes.py opens webcam and moves cursor around

Note: I messed up some of the number of perceptrons before pushing, that might need some tweaking, otherwise its ready to go!
